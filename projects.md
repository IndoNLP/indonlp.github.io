## IndoNLI

IndoNLI is the first human-elicited Natural Language Inference (NLI) dataset for Indonesian. IndoNLI is annotated by both crowd workers and experts. The expert-annotated data is used exclusively as a test set. It is designed to provide a challenging test-bed for Indonesian NLI by explicitly incorporating various linguistic phenomena such as numerical reasoning, structural changes, idioms, or temporal and spatial reasoning.
