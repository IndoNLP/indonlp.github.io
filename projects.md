# On-going Projects

## NusaCrowd
We will initiate a hackathon to centralize many NLP datasets in Indonesian and local languages. Indonesian languages are diverse and scattered, so a unified location that joins multiple sources while preserving the data closest to the original form can greatly help accessibility. We propose a unified schema for dataset extraction to implement as many datasets as possible to enable reproducibility in data processing. Stay tuned for the next update!

# Past Projects

## NusaX

NusaX is a high-quality multilingual parallel corpus for Indonesian local languages elicited by native speakers. NusaX covers 12 languages, Indonesian, English, and 10 Indonesian local languages, namely Acehnese, Balinese, Banjarese, Buginese, Madurese, Minangkabau, Javanese, Ngaju, Sundanese, and Toba Batak.

**Paper**: NusaX: Multilingual Parallel Sentiment Dataset for 10 Indonesian Local Languages [(Winata., et al 2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15960.pdf)

## IndoNLI

IndoNLI is the first human-elicited Natural Language Inference (NLI) dataset for Indonesian. IndoNLI is annotated by both crowd workers and experts. The expert-annotated data is used exclusively as a test set. It is designed to provide a challenging test-bed for Indonesian NLI by explicitly incorporating various linguistic phenomena such as numerical reasoning, structural changes, idioms, or temporal and spatial reasoning.
