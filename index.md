Indonesian languages are underrepresented in global NLP research community ([Aji., et al 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.500.pdf)).
Despite having more than 700 diverse languages across Indonesia, NLP research and technologies only focus on a tiny fraction of them. IndoNLP is a research community with a mission to advance Indonesian language NLP research.

## Challenges

- **Low-resource**: The lack of resource (i.e. dataset or model) is one of the challenge of Indonesian NLP. Some of existing resources are hard to find since they are not released publicly, or locked behind institutional biuroecacy. Therefore, global communities (esp. those that do not speak Indonesian) is having difficulty to adapt their research and technology to Indonesian languages.

- **Language and Dialect diversity**: Indonesian local languages are rich on dialects. The same local language might be spoken differently within cities/villages. They also often use different language style depending on their speaking partners (i.e. casual vs polite).

- **Multilinguality**: Most of Indonesian is at least bilingual: they can speak Indonesian + their own local language. In addition, they often learn other languages as well such as English, Arabic, Chinese etc, due to school or religion reason. Therefore, their daily conversations are filled with code-switching, and these languages are intertwined with each other.

See our current project(s) and if any of those interest you, please reach us!
You can also contact us if you have cool ideas or looking for a collaborations with local researchers.

We are currently building a crowd-sourced, Indonesian resources covering as many local languages as possible. We are also encouraging local researchers to release their existing resource which was locked behind private institution to be more accessible, thus advancing the progress in Indonesian NLP.
